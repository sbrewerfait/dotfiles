# Here we go, then - an ASCII screensaver of cuteness. It's a bit rudimentary,
# but hey... It was made with love in about 45 minutes whilst waiting for a flight.

# A huge shoutout to some of the most wonderful cuties I know:
# Mispy, Catherine, Ninji, Fiora, __builtin_trap, Gewt, Hachidorii, Kwanre, Talen, Whitequark, Louise, Emma, Chris, Katnarine, Dirt, Nimby, Hoodie, Simon...
# The list goes on. I love you all.

# Anyway, on with the cuteness. Let's load some title art.
