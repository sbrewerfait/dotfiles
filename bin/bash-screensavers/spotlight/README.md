# Tools

This directory contains scripts for managing and maintaining the screensaver gallery.

## `install-all-the-stuff.sh`

This script installs the necessary dependencies for the other tools. It can install `asciinema` and `agg` on macOS, Debian/Ubuntu, Arch Linux, and other Linux distributions.

**Usage:**
```bash
./tools/install-all-the-stuff.sh
```

## `smile-for-the-camera.sh`

This script generates an animated GIF preview for each screensaver in the `gallery`. It uses `asciinema` to record a short session of each screensaver and `agg` to convert the recording into a GIF.

**Usage:**
```bash
./tools/smile-for-the-camera.sh
```
The generated GIFs will be saved in the respective screensaver's directory (e.g., `gallery/alpha/alpha.gif`).

## `tour-the-gallery.sh`

This script creates an overview of all the screensavers in the gallery. It records a short snippet of each screensaver and then concatenates them into a single `overview.cast` file and a corresponding `overview.gif` file in the root directory.

**Usage:**
```bash
./tools/tour-the-gallery.sh
```

## `spread-the-word.sh`

This script generates a series of shell commands to create a "spotlight" message on the main GitHub repository page. It does this by generating commands that make trivial changes to the top 12 files and directories and then commit those changes with custom messages.

**Usage:**

1.  **Customize the message:** Edit the `spotlight/message.txt` file. It should contain exactly 12 lines. Emojis and UTF-8 characters are welcome!
2.  **Generate the commands:** Run the script from the root of the repository:
    ```bash
    ./spotlight/spread-the-word.sh
    ```
3.  **Run the commands:** The script will output a series of shell commands. These commands will first modify the files, and then use `git add` and `git commit` to commit the changes. Review them, and if they look correct, copy and paste them into your terminal to execute them.
